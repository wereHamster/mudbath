            Mudbath is a self-hosted continuous deployment server which
            is fully integrated into <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.
            The only way how it can be triggered is through the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/">GitHub deployments API</a>.
            That encourages you to simplify your deployment process and manage
            it through <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github">ChatOps</a>
            tools.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <a href="./installation.html">installation</a> is simple, and there is very little
            to <a href="./configuration.html">configure</a>. This makes mudbath easy to get started with.
